Note*
I did not really write this code! This was 99% written by ChatGPT and I just compiled everything together. I'm not really a programmer so please don't be too harsh on the code. 
This is a very early version of the program so there is likely to be many bugs still so please let me know if you run into any issues. If you have any other suggestions for improvements, I would love to hear them from you <3
