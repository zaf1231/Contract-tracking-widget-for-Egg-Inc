Changes you need to make to the code (in "Coop tracker.py" or "Coop tracker (no text).py")
- Line 13: Change path to correct folder
- Line 14: Change player EID
- Line 15: Choose a universal scale size (default is best for 1080p displays)
- Line 15 and 16: Set x and y position


Running the program
- Open "launcher.py" or "launcher (no text).py" to run the program
- If not working, try opening "Coop widget.py" as it will open terminal window which may show what has gone wrong
- If still not working DM me and I'll see if I can help with your issues :)


Open automatically on startup
- Create a shortcut of "launcher.py"
- Press "WINDOWS + R"
- Type in "shell:startup" and press enter
- Drag the shortcut of launcher.py into that folder and it will start up when you restart your computer :)


Note*
I did not really write this code! This was 99% written by ChatGPT and I just compiled everything together. This is a very early version of the program so there is likely to be many bugs still so please let me know if you run into any issues. If you have any other suggestions for improvements, I would love to hear them from you.

Big thanks to WeccaÂ³Dude 2.30s (Federico9292) for beta testing and suggesting new features <3
